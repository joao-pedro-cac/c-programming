## Easy problems

- `minMax.c`: Given a list of numbers, outputs them and prints **>** right after the largest one and **<** right after the smallest one.
- `quaisDiv.c`: Given a sequence of numbers and a number _n_, prints their elements followed by an **#** if the number is a divisor of _n_.
- `somatorio.c`: Given some numbers, outputs their sum.
- `produtorio.c`: Given some numbers, outputs their product.

## Medium problems

- `muSigma.c`: Given some numbers, displays their arithmetic average and standard deviation.
- `remNegativos.c`: Given a sequence of numbers, displays every non-negative element. If there are none, outputs _vazio_ (empty), meaning "there are no non-negative elements".

## Hard problems

- `diferencas.c`: Given an array _A_ of _n_ numbers, creates a list _B_ of _n - 1_ numbers, such that the *i*th element of _B_ equals the (*i + 1*)th element of _A_ minus the *i*th element of _A_. The list _B_ is then displayed as well as its smallest and largest numbers.
