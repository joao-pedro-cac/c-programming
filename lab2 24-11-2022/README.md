## Easy problems

- `dist.c`: Distance between two points in a cartesian plane.
- `impares.c`: Prints all odd numbers from _a_ to _b_ (_a < b_).
- `areaTriRet.c`: Area of a right triangle.
- `divisores.c`: Lists all divisors of a number.


## Medium problems

- `somaPrimos.c`: Sum of all prime numbers from _a_ to _b_ (_a < b_).
- `somaSeqHailst.c`: Sum of all numbers in a Hailstone sequence from _n_ to _1_ (_n > 1_) generated by [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).


## Hard problems

- `maxHappyPrime.c`: Calculates the largest [happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number) prime number in an interval from 1 to _n_. Outputs _0_ if there is no happy prime number in the interval.
